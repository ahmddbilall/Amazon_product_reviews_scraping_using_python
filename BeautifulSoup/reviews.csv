Totally capable and worth the buy",06/08/2024,"I recently bought this machine for two purposes. The deal was I'd use this for my freelance work for a month while my 2019 Macbook Pro was being fixed and then my niece gets it for college. So it's really a gift, but I got to use it for a few weeks.My biggest grip is that the ports are all on one side, the side that makes plugging things in on my desk awkward. My Macbook Pro has two ports on each side, and I always end up using the right side ports for charging and for the dongle.But I almost never use it as a LAPtop. It's really a desktop machine that I take from desk to desk with rare appearances not plugged into an external monitor and other devices. It is more portable than my Pro but not enough for it to make a big difference. On a small popup desk in a university auditorium and bouncing around campus, this is probably more noticeable, I just don't have the experience to comment.I only use one external monitor but for power users using two monitors the new M3 chip probably makes a big difference. I don't even know if my 2019 Pro with an Intel chip can do this, I've never tried. But I think power users requiring multiple monitors are aiming for the Pro.Running high-ish intensity apps like IntelliJ with multiple apps in the background, I have to concede that this machine is a little slower than my 2019 Pro. But I think that's largely to do with the fact that my main machine has more RAM. With solid state memory being the norm these days it doesn't matter much, and really even high intensity tasks that make my pro's fan start up only take maybe a second or two more on this machine.I'm not an Apple preacher. I still haven't decided whether I like macOS more than Windows. But Apple hardware seems to be better than any PC hardware in this price range. PC laptops seem to degrade faster, mostly the battery. PC laptop batteries go from 18 hours to 2 hours over the course of 5 years. My Pro battery went from 18 or so to 4 over 5 years. And these days you can't change a PC battery with this form factor either.The Pro screen is definitely better, but again I'm using an external monitor 99% of the time, so it doesn't matter much for me.If you're running high intensity apps you should go for the Pro still, but the difference isn't really that huge. If you're doing things that don't involve high intensity calculations this is probably the best machine on the market especially for the money.If you're trying to decide between this and a PC of similar price and reputation, this is probably the first time I'd say Apple is offering a better product for the money. This machine is cheaper than it should be. So it's really a decision between macOS and Windows. Mac has the better command line out of the box but similar Windows tools can be installed just as easily. For gaming, Windows wins, but this isn't a gaming device. The best benefit to macOS for my work is that my employer won't give administrative privs to Windows users, but for macOS they haven't removed that yet, so I can actually do my job without having to ask permission to install an ad blocker in Chrome. Huge plus."

Great laptop, too small for my workflow",14/06/2024,"Objectively speaking, the M3 16 gb ram w/ 512 storage is a 5-star computer all day, so I am giving 5-stars.This is a great device, but everyone already knows that, so I am focusing on two big considerations that I had - specs and size. I am just a layperson who primarily uses this device for office work.In sum, wish I could keep this one, but it's just too small. This size is will be great for many users. Further, I will not ever buy a base model (8/256), but many people would probably be fine with base model.Specs-I originally bought a base model M2 (8/256) but swapped it out for the M3 16/512. With a brand new base model M2, I was constantly using memory swap and in yellow memory pressure. This happened immediately and took almost nothing. In addition, I only had ~80 gb of memory left after MacOS, iMessage, etc. took up most of the space on my hard-drive. I spent 2 days trouble-shooting this issue with Apple - turns out my only real option was to spec up. I bought the base model thinking I would be okay since I use cloud based services for everything. I was wrong. For ME, the super savings on the base model are NOT worth it. The savings will be worth it for other people with different needs and preferences. (And, again, I am a just layperson w/ tech. Just trying to share my lay opinion from my experience. Take with grain of salt.)Size-I actually love the size of the 13-inch, but for my work use, the screen is just too small. I use this laptop for work and personal, but my workflow is the most important consideration. I tend to multitask and juggle multiple word processing documents, pdfs, excel spreadsheets, and internet browser tabs. I also use split screen. I just cannot see enough text at once when I review documents - this causes decreased productivity and a far less comfortable experience.So, I have to size up to the 15-inch. If this was JUST a personal laptop, I would keep the 13-inch and absolutely love it.Also, I went to a store and tested out both sizes before purchasing, but that did not help me. Unfortunately, I had to test drive with my actual workflow before I realized the 13-inch was insufficient for my needs.Oh, one other thing. I love the midnight color. But all the fingerprint concerns are 100% legit (even with the M3, which I really did not notice the supposed improvement). I happen to find the beautiful color to be worth the fingerprints, but if that bothers you - do not buy midnight.Good luck, everyone!"

Perfection in every way",28/07/2024,"First off, the size for the 13 inch air Mac is a big enough size for a screen. I was expecting it to be smaller, but was pleasantly surprised.The quality of the screen and resolution and whatnots are impeccable. This runs like a dream. Unless you’re just setting it up and then it takes a bit to get going due to all the information you’re logging back in with if you’re an Apple user.The appearance of this thing is beautiful. I don’t know if I’ve ever seen a nicer looking laptop than this one. It’s really sleek looking. Very slim too. Also very very very light, so careful when handling it.The keyboard is practically silent when you’re typing on it.The speed on it after setting it up blew me away and I’m so happy I made this purchase. It feels so easy to use when you’re on it.Highly recommend this laptop to any Apple user that was the M3 chip, a newer laptop upgrade and something to do what you need to off of it. It’s amazing."

2024 M3 Air",05/08/2024,"As a long term apple user and this being my 3rd apple computer (2017 macbook pro i5) (2021 mac mini m2) and this, its very robust in its biuld, feels like alluminum, screen quality is immaculate, very nice color, sounds decent for laptop speakers, scored 39,500 on Silverbench.com on the benchmark test as well as can denoise an image in adobe lightroom classic in under 20 seconds, gaming is also not an issue with the new air, i can run even more complex mac native games on max graphics and it doesnt even get hot. battery life will easily last all day, keyboard is comfortable and easy to type on, one drawback is they took away the app search button and you have to use the spotlight. overall a really solid work laptop"

First ever MacBook for School",07/07/2024,"My first ever MacBook. Have always been a windows guy but thought I’d give it a try. Overall it’s been about two months of using and I love it so far. Have had multiple people comment how nice my laptop looks.Been using this for school. Decided to finish my senior year online. Truthfully I was a little worried about the 8gb of RAM as most laptops I’ve had have had 16. That being said, I’ve had no issues with it and it has run multiple tabs and windows well seamlessly flowing between them. Have loved working on this for school. Not much storage on the laptop, but really hadn’t been an issue as I use iCloud and OneDrive for school work.Biggest thing I love is the battery life. It last so long compared to all my other laptops I’ve owned and I don’t feel tethered to my charger at all.Overall, if you’re budget allows, I think this is great laptop for school and work. Wouldn’t recommend for gaming or anything like that, but for just about everything else it seems great. And again, for anyone else wondering like I was , the 8gb model has been more tan enough for my school work so far."

Making the change from Windows to Mac",11/08/2024,Received my MacBook Air as promised. Impressed with packaging. Easy to turn on and get started. A little bit of a learning curve as this is my first Mac. Love the integration with my iPhone and iPad and even login by having my Apple Watch on my wrist. Installed apps easily and able to do my basic functions quickly.

Amazing product. Lacking 5 stars because of the lack of dual monitor support",31/07/2024,"My 2017 MacBook pro died recently, so needed an upgrade.Upgraded to the M3 MacBook air.It really is a beautiful device. A little pricey, but hey thats Macs for ya.The only flaw: the lack of being able to use 2 external monitors with the lid open.My 2017 intel based MacBook pro could do this.This is supposed to be their most powerful chip, kind of crazy they couldn't match what intel could do.Luckily there is a $100 work around (rather than having to spend something like $1,000 extra on an upgraded model with an M3 Pro/Max chip)...look for usb hubs with DisplayLink technology - so that you can use 3 screens at once if thats what you care about. Has worked great with this Mac.Again would be 5 stars if they didn't have the external display limit"

Love it",31/07/2024,"I use this for college. The battery life is absolutely amazing. I still need to figure out how to navigate through it but i definitely recommend. It came brand new, it works fast, it has some weight to it like a couple of pounds but it’s nice and thin. The sound quality is amazing too like a normal computer would have. It is amazing but i think any MacBook would be good. I didn’t like the price of it but other than that, it’s wonderful. I got it on sale during July 4th, I recommend waiting a bit for it to go on sale again!"

My first MacBook and I love it!",28/07/2024,I didn’t open it until I took a MacBook class at Apple today and was relieved to know it is much more user friendly than I thought it would be. I had just upgraded to an IPhone 15 Pro so I was thrilled how many things sync.Looking forward to really getting to take advantage of all its features once I have played around with all the options.

The box was sealed. Am not seeing any fingerprints on it. The screen is so sharp and clear compared to other laptops. The speakers are working great.Quality is like 9/10Appearance is 10/10Screen clarity is 10/10The only think is am wondering how to insert a flash drive because the port is different.

Amazing Apple Product!!",18/07/2024,"I've been using this MacBook Air for the past two weeks and, It didn't disappoint. This MacBook has been running smoothly with any programs it runs, It is capable to run multiple programs. For Example, say you are doing a project and will require multiple programs to run all while listening to music in the background, well with the M3 Chip, all that is possible, Compared to previous MacBook's, I couldn't express that this MacBook is well worth the money."

I am a grad student at Michigan State and my HP died. I needed a Laptop for school, which starts end if August.Here are the pro’s and con’s of the M3 13. macbook airPros1 The keyboard is of great quality and I like the fact that it comes with backlight. It helps for typing in the evening.M3 processorI got a stock laptop and even 8 GB of Ram amd 256 SSD is not horrible. I paid $35 and got a 256 external SSD drive3- beat battery life. Even on optimized settings for watching videos and gaming, you get a solid 11 hours of battery life.The 15” Macbook air get’s about 8 and the macboom Pro’s are in between4 the quality. Nothing beats Apple, I like to keep my laptops for about five years and with the Mackbook air, you can.5 Price When Amazon has a sale it becomes very affordable I bought this for $900 out the doorCaveat there are Cons1 Price for upgrades. Amazon and Apple are charging $200 for 16 GB or Ram $400 for 24 GB and $200 for 512 SSD and $400 for 1TB.Apple care is expensive over $200 even for the cheapest MacBook Air, stock.It is for these reasons wh I have to take away one start and not give a full 5 stars."

amazing but has flaws",17/07/2024,"Apple 2024 MacBook Air 13-inch Laptop with M3 ChipThe Apple 2024 MacBook Air with the new M3 chip is a mixed bag. While it boasts impressive speed and efficiency, thanks to Apple’s proprietary chip, there are significant drawbacks. The laptop remains outrageously expensive, putting it out of reach for many potential buyers. The limited port selection is another frustrating aspect, requiring multiple dongles for basic connectivity needs. Although the Retina display is stunning, the laptop's build quality feels surprisingly fragile for a premium product. Battery life, though decent, doesn’t live up to the hype Apple has created around it. For a machine that is supposed to represent the future of laptops, it feels more like a costly compromise."

Impressive performance",11/07/2024,"mpressive Performance and Sleek DesignThe Apple 2024 MacBook Air is a fantastic upgrade. The 13.6-inch Liquid Retina Display is stunning, offering vibrant colors and sharp details. The 8GB of unified memory and 512GB SSD storage ensure smooth performance and ample space for all my files and applications.The M3 chip significantly boosts speed and efficiency, making multitasking and running demanding applications a breeze. The backlit keyboard is comfortable to type on, and Touch ID provides quick and secure access to the laptop. The 1080p FaceTime HD camera is a great improvement, offering clear and crisp video quality for virtual meetings.The Midnight finish is sleek and modern, adding a touch of elegance to the overall design. Battery life is excellent, lasting through a full day of work without needing a recharge.

For anyone wondering if the base model is enough, let me assure you - it absolutely is!",10/07/2024,"I recently purchased the 2024 MacBook Air M3 (base model) and it has completely blown me away. For anyone wondering if the base model is enough, let me assure you - it absolutely is!Here's what I love:Powerhouse Performance: The M3 chip is incredibly powerful. I haven't experienced any lag, even with multiple demanding applications open. This thing chews through everyday tasks and even handles some light photo and video editing without breaking a sweat.Featherlight Design: This laptop is unbelievably light. I can barely feel it in my bag, making it perfect for commuting or travel.Battery Life for Days: The battery life is nothing short of phenomenal. I easily get a full day's work done on a single charge, and then some!Stunning Display: The bezels are practically non-existent, giving you maximum screen real estate. And what a screen it is! The colors are vibrant, the text is sharp, and it's a joy to work on.Incredible Value: You get so much for your money with this laptop. It's the perfect balance of performance, portability, and price.Overall:This MacBook Air is a triumph. Apple has knocked it out of the park with the M3 chip and refined design. If you're looking for a powerful, portable, and long-lasting laptop, look no further than the 2024 MacBook Air M3. You won't be disappointed!"

Not worth the money, performs less than PC",09/08/2024,"This is my 3rd Apple in a row, for a decade I have used both machines.Both have pros and cons, to be sure but Apple is brutal on anything non-Apple:That means anything you own that isn't Mac is gonna struggle or not work with it.Also, so many functions just don't work well.I fight the fingerprint every single time I use it.I have to de-do the process monthly, or it does nothing.Sometimes the mouse pad doesn't work.Other times, the Safari app just freezes and nothing worksOften, my Mac compatible printer just won't work, scan or print.So, for the fun stuff it's great, security is okbut it works against me more than with me-75% of the time it locks me out even thoughall passwords and everything has remained the same.If you're all in on all Apple then it may be a good solution for you.For me, as long as they're being so constrictive and prohibitive-and the APPLE HELP is nearly worthless-Hours on the phone or in a line,and no help on line or on the machine itself.I go to help groups to figure out how to do basic thingsand even then, no one knows and Apple doesn't help.I just got one of their best tools and found it so unpleasant to useI will go back to all PC where at least things work well and easily.Peace"

Nice laptop",25/06/2024,Wish I had gotten the MacBook Pro so I could use my experiences cords and plugs but this does what I needed it for. If using for work I would go for more memory. Nice looking and great battery life.

Not a bad deal but…..",31/07/2024,"I received it with a broken screen.I was so excited. Waiting for it to come was like Christmas because it is for school, and when it did i just had to open it immediately. I took it out of the box like it was a newborn baby. My mom and gram thought it was funny. But once it turned on to the welcome main starter screen. We all could see the LCD under the screen broke and looked like it was leaking across the bottom of the screen. Thankfully I bought it with AppleCare+ and drove 2 hours to be told to come back in 3 days to drop it off; just to pick it up in a week with it fixed. So that’s minimal 6 hours of waisted gas and no computer for school.So I am just glad that Apple themself is actually doing the right thing because Amazon was not going to help."

What a Joy. Another Great Apple Upgrade",16/06/2024,Upgraded from a 2020 Retina screen Macbook Air. This one feels 1000% faster and the keyboard is so much better. Just love it. The longer lasting battery is super helpful. I'd recommend this computer to anyone who doesn't use it to make movies or play video games (only because I don't know what those requirements might be).

Excellent!",20/06/2024,I was a little skeptical purchasing an apple computer on Amazon but nothing to be worried about in the end. Everything came extremely well packaged. My son loves his new computer and it was great getting the efficiency through Amazon.

Love it. There really is a difference!",15/05/2024,"I finally had it watching little wheels spin around on my other PC laptops. The final straw occurred at the beginning of May when I was about to record a legal video deposition, and I needed the PC to capture video that could be streamed to law firms across the country. Surprisingly, my PC decided to upgrade just when I was about to begin, even though I had it running the night before. I was accompanied by a handful of attorneys waiting for me to start. After a few minutes, I excused myself, went to the parking garage, and retrieved a backup computer. Fortunately, that machine booted in a few minutes. That's when I decided to purchase a MAC.  This machine is fast; it just does it when I ask it to do something, such as open a video. It also has a refined feel and is amazingly compact. Do I have the buyer's remorse? No, I do not."

I had 2017 mac before, so it was time to upgrade. I decided to get a similar laptop to what I had before, and my pick was 2024 MacBook Air. I am happy with my choice so far, it has been a few months now. It works great, fast and lightweight! Holds battery for a LONG time, which is my favorite part about Apple honestly."

Just what I needed",31/05/2024,"I've been using Macs since the little tan box that people now use as fish bowls so I wasn't surprised that this MacBook is fast and convenient. The battery lasts much longer than I expected and charges relatively quickly. Being a fireman's wife, I check for heat both on the charger and the computer case while it's charging and don't detect any. However, I never leave any device charging when no one is around. That's just common sense. It's  lot of computer for the money and I'm happy I bought it."

Shipment Promise kept",15/05/2024,"The item arrived to my house on time, and because I wasn't home to receive it: theres always the advantage of having your home all fenced in, and all gates locked.  It is lighter than my older lap top, and it is easier to carry (now that I'm 65, things seem heavier than in the past). I like that I can carry it with me wherever I go. It came well protected (a box within a box), and delivered on time."

Laptop is great - fast, lightweight and intuitive for the most part (maybe not so if coming from Windows). I tend to have some relearning whenI am on a Windows machine. Only complaint right now is price/capacity."
